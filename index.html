          <h1>What is COVID-19?</h1>
            <p>COVID-19 is a new disease caused by a type of coronavirus
            that has never been seen in humans. Since it's new, scientists have yet to learn
            more about it. This caused an outbreak that led to the 2020 pandemic It is better defined
            as an acute illness that can affect anyone. This not only affected the bodies of many, but the
            mental health of all. We hope with the information on this website, you can better prepare
            yourself and loved ones to end this disease. .</p>

          <h1>Symptoms & Prevention</h1>
            <p>Every body reacts differently to COVID-19 so not all symptoms will be the same or 
            present when contagious. Some people are asymptomatic when they have COVID-19 and for 
            others, it may cause death. It is important to get tested and prevent catching COVID-19.
            You should look out for symptoms on this list: <br> - Fever or chills <br> - Cough <br> 
              - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing <br> - Fatigue <br> - Muscle or body aches <br> 
              - Headache <br> 
              - New loss of taste or smell <br> 
              - Sore throat <br> 
              - Congestion or runny nose <br>
              - Nausea or vomiting <br> 
              - Diarrhea <br><br> 
            There are some prevention tips that can help stop the spread of 
            COVID-19. They are as follows: <br> 
              - Get a COVID-19 vaccine when it’s available to you. <br>
              - Wear a mask to protect yourself and others and stop the spread of COVID-19. <br>
              - Stay at least 6 feet away from others who don’t live with you. <br>
              - Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces. <br>
              - Clean your hands often, either with soap and water or a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. <br>
              - Avoid close contact with people who are sick. <br>
              - Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue. <br>
              - Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces daily. <br>
